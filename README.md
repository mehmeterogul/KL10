## üìùTo-Do List
### Core game mechanics
- [x] Fill the game board with empty cells using scripting
- [x] Create prefabs of shapes
- [x] Create shape spawner
- [x] Player Input: Shape selection
- [x] Player Input: Placing shapes on proper position
- [x] Limitation of placing position
- [x] Clear filled rows and colums
- [ ] BUG: The functions that will clear rows and columns has working seperately. So thats why if we place a shape that should clear rows and colums at the same time, that doesn't work. It's only clear rows or columns at the same time.
